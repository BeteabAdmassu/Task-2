# API Specification

All endpoints are REST-style, consumed by HTMX partial updates. Responses return HTML fragments for HTMX requests (`HX-Request` header present) and JSON for direct API calls. All state-changing endpoints require CSRF tokens and, for sensitive actions, signed request timestamps with anti-replay nonces.

```

### Idempotency
- `_request_token` (UUID) generated per form load, consumed on use
- Duplicate token → 409 Conflict with "This action has already been processed"
